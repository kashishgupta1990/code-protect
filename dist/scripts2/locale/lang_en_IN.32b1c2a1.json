So far I have shortlisted -- a) Prateek Wisteria (Sec-77) and b) Prateek Laurel (Sec-120). Here are my questions - 1) Which one out of the two is a better option and why? 2) Has the developer got all the required clearances, for the above-mentioned projects? 3) Are there any better choices available around the same area? 4) It is better to buy a fresh property than a resale one? 5) Will the area in and around sec-77, 120 (Noida) be livable in the next 6 months or so (from the safety standpoint, in particular)? 6) Should I consider Noida X-Way projects over the ones mentioned above? If so, please can you share a couple of good ones? Many thanks.

A lot of personal factors go into buying a property. Is the location close to your work place? Is it close to your children school? How has the area developed in the past and what are the facilities available to counter day to day needs. Based on your personal requirement you may purchase appropriate property. From what we can suggest is that sector 120 has been much talked about as it has already existing metro. Sector 77/78 has metro proposed but not existing. Development will be faster where you already have infrastructure in place. You have to do your due diligence on the project to find out about permissions and other legalities. Resale properties are usually more expensive. It depends on the urgency of your need. There are many projects in sector 120 which are upcoming. They are Amrapali Zodiac, RG Residency apart from Prateek Laurel. We cannot comment on the safety at this point of time as it all depends on the future development. Noida Expressway is any day better as for the connectivity is concerned.", "isReplied": "true", "depth": "1", "createdDate": "", "status": "1", "user": { "USERNAME": "PropTiger" } } ] } ] } }
